To run this website you need to follow some steps,
Firstly make shure you have installed python in your system and more important you have added path, to check this simply open your CMD and typr python --version and press enter if this throws you an error like python not recognised then you need to add it to path or if it shows you the version of python you are good to go to next step.
1. Download and extract this forlder.
2. Then open the main folder in CMD.
3. Then you need to write a lime of code that is :- "python manage.py runserver".
